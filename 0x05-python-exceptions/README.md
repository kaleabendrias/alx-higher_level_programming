Exception Handling in Python
General
This repository contains examples and code snippets demonstrating the use of exceptions in Python programming. Python is an awesome programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Exception handling is an essential aspect of Python programming that allows us to gracefully handle errors and unexpected situations in our code.

Differences between Errors and Exceptions
In Python, errors and exceptions are related but distinct concepts. Errors typically refer to mistakes or bugs in the code that prevent it from executing properly. Exceptions, on the other hand, are events that occur during program execution that disrupt the normal flow of the program.

Understanding Exceptions and Their Usage
Exceptions in Python are objects that represent errors or exceptional conditions. They allow us to handle exceptional situations and perform alternative actions or provide appropriate error messages. By using exceptions, we can make our code more robust, reliable, and easier to maintain.

When to Use Exceptions
Exceptions should be used in situations where we anticipate and want to handle specific types of errors or exceptional conditions. Some common scenarios where exceptions are useful include:

Input validation and error handling
File operations and handling file-related errors
Network operations and handling connection errors
Database interactions and handling query errors
External API calls and handling response errors
Correctly Handling Exceptions
To correctly handle exceptions, we need to use the try-except block. The code that may raise an exception is placed inside the try block, and the corresponding exception handling code is placed inside the except block. This allows us to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.

Purpose of Catching Exceptions
Catching exceptions enables us to handle errors and exceptional situations in a controlled manner. By catching exceptions, we can prevent our program from crashing, display meaningful error messages to users, and take appropriate actions to recover from the error or continue program execution.

Raising Built-in Exceptions
Python provides a wide range of built-in exceptions that can be raised when specific errors or conditions occur. Raising exceptions allows us to generate and handle specific types of errors in our code. We can use the raise statement to raise a built-in exception or create custom exceptions.

Implementing Clean-up Actions after an Exception
In some cases, we may need to perform clean-up actions or release resources even if an exception occurs. For this purpose, we can use the finally block in combination with the try-except block. The code inside the finally block will execute regardless of whether an exception was raised or not, making it suitable for clean-up actions.

Repository Contents
This repository contains various examples, code snippets, and explanations demonstrating the concepts mentioned above. The examples cover different scenarios where exceptions are commonly used in Python programming. Each code file is self-contained and includes comments for better understanding.

Feel free to explore the examples and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of exception handling in Python.

Happy coding!
