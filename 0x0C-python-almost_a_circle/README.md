# Project Title

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Explain the concept of unit testing and implement it in a large project.
- Serialize and deserialize a class.
- Read and write JSON files.
- Understand and utilize `*args` in Python.
- Understand and utilize `**kwargs` in Python.
- Handle named arguments in a function.

## Copyright - Plagiarism

This project requires you to come up with your own solutions to the tasks in order to meet the learning objectives stated above. Copying and pasting someone else's work is strictly prohibited. Publishing any content related to this project is not allowed. Plagiarism in any form will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines (use `pycodestyle` version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- All modules should be documented using the command `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`.
- All classes should be documented using the command `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`.
- All functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented using the commands `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`.
- Documentation should consist of complete sentences explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method. The length of the documentation will be verified.

### Python Unit Tests

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files should end with a new line.
- All test files should be located inside a `tests` folder.
- `unittest` module should be used for testing.
- All test files should have a `.py` extension.
- All test files and folders should start with `test_`.
- The organization of test files in the `tests` folder should mirror the structure of the project. For example, if the project has a file `models/base.py`, the corresponding unit test file should be located at `tests/test_models/test_base.py`.
- All tests should be executed using the command `python3 -m unittest discover tests`.
- Individual test files can be executed using the command `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py`.
- Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to cover all possible edge cases.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

1. Clone the project repository.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

### Usage

- Execute the Python scripts by running the following command:

```bash
python3 <script-name>.py
```

- Run the unit tests by executing the following command:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```

## File Structure

The project should follow the following file structure:

```
project/
├── module1.py
├── module2.py
├── tests/
│   ├── test_module1.py
│   ├── test_module2.py
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

The `module1.py` and `module2.py` files contain the Python code for implementing the required functionality. The `tests` folder contains unit test files corresponding to each module. The `README.md` file provides information about the project and its requirements.

## Task Implementation

To meet the learning objectives outlined above, you need to implement the following tasks:

1. Implement unit testing in a large project.
2. Serialize and deserialize a class.
3. Read and write JSON files.
4. Understand and utilize `*args` in Python.
5. Understand and utilize `**kwargs` in Python.
6. Handle named arguments in a function.

By completing these tasks, you will gain a solid understanding of unit testing, serialization, deserialization, JSON manipulation, and working with different argument types in Python.

Remember to avoid plagiarism and come up with your own solutions for each task.

**Note:** If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out for assistance. Good luck with the project!
