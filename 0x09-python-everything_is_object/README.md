# Object-oriented Programming in Python - README

This project focuses on understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It covers various topics related to classes, objects, mutability, references, assignments, and more. By completing the tasks in this project, you will gain a solid understanding of OOP principles and how they apply in Python.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you will be able to:

- Explain the reasons why Python programming is awesome.
- Understand the concept of an object and its significance in Python.
- Differentiate between a class, an object (instance), and a variable.
- Identify the differences between mutable and immutable objects.
- Define and comprehend the terms reference, assignment, and alias.
- Determine if two variables are identical or linked to the same object.
- Display the variable identifier (memory address) using the CPython implementation.
- Differentiate between mutable and immutable data types in Python.
- Identify the built-in mutable and immutable types in Python.
- Understand how Python passes variables to functions.

## Copyright - Plagiarism

All the solutions for the tasks in this project must be developed independently. Copying and pasting someone else's work, or any form of plagiarism, is strictly prohibited and will result in removal from the program. It is essential to come up with your own solutions to meet the project's objectives.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a newline character
- The first line of all your script files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Your code should follow the pycodestyle style guide (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using the `wc` command

### .txt Answer Files

- Only one line
- No Shebang
- All your files should end with a new line

## Repository Structure

- Each task is typically represented by a separate Python script or text file.
- The main project directory should contain a README.md file providing an overview of the project.
- All the code files and answer files should be placed in the appropriate directories according to the project structure guidelines.

Make sure to adhere to the project requirements and structure while developing your solutions.

**Good luck with the project!**
