# Project README

This is a project that consists of Python scripts and test cases. The following are the requirements and guidelines to follow for this project.

## Requirements
- Python Scripts
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - Execution environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python 3.8.5
  - All Python files should end with a new line character.
  - The first line of all Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
  - All files must be executable.
  - Code style: Your code should adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) guidelines.

- README.md File
  - There should be a README.md file at the root of the project folder.
  - The README file should provide information about the project.

## Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Test files
  - All test files should be placed inside a folder named `tests`.
  - All test files should have a .txt extension.
- Test execution
  - All tests should be executed using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.
- Documentation
  - All Python modules should have documentation. You can print the module documentation using the command: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`.
  - All Python classes should have documentation. You can print the class documentation using the command: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`.
  - All functions (both inside and outside a class) should have documentation. You can print the function documentation using the command: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`.
  - Documentation should be a complete sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method. The length of the documentation will be verified.

## Collaboration
- Collaboration on test cases is strongly encouraged to cover all possible edge cases.
- Avoid using the words "import" or "from" inside comments, as the checker may misinterpret them as attempts to import modules.

Please ensure that you follow these guidelines while working on the project.
